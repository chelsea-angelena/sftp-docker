## Run in Docker:

`make run-local`

_note:_ you will need to set your own password in the dockerfile, or use the provided password in order to log in

### Connect

- Check your SSH access using one of these commands:
  `ssh user@server_ipaddress` 
  `ssh user@remotehost_domainname`
- Once that is done, leave the session if no errors occurred.
- Initiate an SFTP connection with the following commands:
  `sftp user@server_ipaddress`
  `sftp user@remotehost_domainname`
- If you’re using a custom SSH port, use one of these commands to change the SFTP port:
  `sftp -oPort=customport user@server_ipaddress`
  `sftp -oPort=customport user@remotehost_domainname`
- Here’s how it should look like:
  `sftp -oPort=49166 user@31.220.57.32`
- Once you’re connected, you will see an SFTP prompt.

### Transferring Remote Files From a Server to the Local System
- Local directory:
  `sftp> lpwd`
  
- Remote directory:
  `sftp> pwd`

#### Transfer file from remote server to your local:
- Get + filepath
    `get /RemoteDirectory/filename.txt`

- For example, to copy the file /etc/xinetd.conf from the remote server to your local machine, you would use:
    `get /etc/xinetd.conf`

 - Once the download is complete, you can now find that the file xinetd.conf is in the /user/home directory of your local machine.

- To download multiple files with SFTP, use the mget command. 
- To download all files in a directory called /etc that have the .conf extension to your current working directory, you will use the following command:

  `mget /etc/*.conf`

- After the download, you can find all *.conf files in /user/home directory of your local machine.

### Transferring Files From the Local Machine to a Remote Server
- Copy a file from local to the remote server:
`get file.txt /RemoteDirectory`

- To move the file example.txt from a local machine to the remote machine, enter the following command:
`put /home/user-name/example.txt /root`

- Find the file in the remote server’s root directory: (You can also try transferring multiple files using the mput command. It works nearly the same as mget):
`mput /home/user-name/*.txt /root`

- This command would move all files with the .txt extension in the /home/user-name from the local machine to the remote /root directory.

_Pro Tip:_  Keep in mind that to download and upload the files with SFTP, you will need to type the command put or get and press the TAB key.

#### Commands for Navigating With SFTP
- Remote directory: /RemoteDirectory
    `sftp> pwd`


- Local directory: /LocalDirectory
    `sftp> lpwd`

- You can also display the list of files and directories you’re using for the remote directory:
`ls`

- Similarly, for the local working directory:
`lls`

- For instance, the output will look similar to this:
Pictures     Templates     Media     Text.txt     Documents

- To switch from one remote working directory to another local working directory, enter the following commands:
`cd name_of_directory`
`lcd name_of_directory`

- Finally, use the ! and exit commands to go back to the local shell and quit SFTP.

#### Basics of File Maintenance Using SFTP
- With SFTP, you can also manage directories and files using specific commands.

- To check the remote server’s disk space in gigabytes, use the df function like so:
`df -h`
- Here’s an output example:

        Filesystem         Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
        /dev/ploop29212p1   59G  2.5G   56G   5% /
        none               1.5G     0  1.5G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
        none               1.5G     0  1.5G   0% /dev
        tmpfs              1.5G     0  1.5G   0% /dev/shm
        tmpfs              1.5G  568K  1.5G   1% /run
        tmpfs              308M     0  308M   0% /run/user/0

- Use the mkdir command to create a new directory on either the remote and local server :
`mkdir name_of_directory`
`lmkdir name_of_directory`

- You can delete one from the remote server using the rmdir command:
`rmdir name_of_directory`

- Meanwhile, renaming a remote file is also rather straightforward:
`rename filename new_filename`

- If you want to remove a remote file, use the rm command:
`rm filename`

- While the chown command is used to replace a file’s owner:
`chown userid filename`

- userid can either be a username or a numeric user ID. For instance:
`chown UserOne FileExample`
`chown 1234 FileExample`

- chgrp is used for changing a file’s group owner:
`chgrp groupid filename`

- For instance:
`chgrp NewGroup FileExample`

- Finally, you will need to use the chmod interactive command to change a file’s permission:
- In this example, the three-digit value stands for the file’s user, group, and other users.
- As for the permissions to read (r), write (w), and execute (x), their values are 4, 2, 1, respectively. 0 can also be used to provide no permissions.
- `chmod 764 FileExample`

- To assign permissions, simply calculate the total values for each user class. Here’s a breakdown of the example:
`chmod ugo FileExample`

***u*** represents the User who'll be able to read, write and execute the file.
***g*** is for Groups, here we've given the permission to write and execute the file.
***o*** or Others will only be able to read the file.
